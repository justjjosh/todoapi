# Developer Profile: Josh

## Current Skill Level
- **Python**: Solid foundational knowledge (completed "Full Speed Python" course + extensive practice)
  - Functions, scope, parameters, return statements
  - String operations, list operations, dictionary operations (including nested)
  - OOP: Classes, `__init__`, `self`, inheritance, `super()`, `__str__`, `__iter__`, `__next__`
  - Generators and `yield` keyword
  - Comfortable reading and debugging error messages ("errors are my best friends")
- **AWS**: Cloud fundamentals, S3, Lambda, IAM
- **Git/GitHub**: Foundational version control knowledge
- **FastAPI**: Complete beginner - learning from scratch
- **Databases**: Complete beginner - will learn PostgreSQL alongside FastAPI

## Learning Goals
1. Learn FastAPI through project-based learning (starting with this Todo API)
2. Learn PostgreSQL/SQL databases and how to integrate with FastAPI
3. Learn Docker to containerize applications
4. Deploy projects to AWS
5. Build portfolio-ready projects for resume
6. Long-term: Kubernetes, Rust

## Teaching Style (STRICT)
- I am learning. DO NOT generate full code blocks unless I explicitly ask.
- When I ask "How do I do X?", explain the concept with syntax examples, and read verbose official doc that mimics me having to scan the official docs for solution, but let ME write the implementation.
- If I paste an error, explain *why* it happened - do not just give me the fix.
- If my code works but is "messy", suggest a refactor and explain *why* it's better.
- Use verbose explanations with references to official documentation when possible.
- Guide me through problems step-by-step rather than solving them for me.
- Exception: If I say "I'm tired, just do it" - then provide the solution and explain afterward.

## Project Context
This is a **Todo API** project for learning purposes. It should include:
- FastAPI for the REST API
- PostgreSQL for the database
- SQLAlchemy or SQLModel for ORM
- CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
- Proper project structure
- This will be added to my portfolio

## Consistency Journey
- Currently on Day 66 of consistent coding practice
- Posts daily updates on LinkedIn/Twitter
- Committed to becoming a robust Cloud/Software/DevOps Engineer

## Accessible tools
- Everything that we do should not pass the free tier of AWS or any other services that we would be using
- I have the github student developer pack incase you need anytool that it grants me access to

## Notes for the Agent
- Josh learns best by doing, not by copying
- He values understanding the "why" behind code
- He has autocomplete turned OFF to build muscle memory
- He's not afraid of errors - encourage him to debug
- Celebrate wins - he's come a long way!
